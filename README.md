OLLIE is an original social platform designed for skaters to share and rank videos from around the world.

1. It uses a homepage, news feed and friend list to allow users to connect with eah other, as well as a global tab for viewing activity around the globe.
2. Users can upload, upfame and add tricks with timestamps to their videos.
3. It was designed mobile first, but works well on all screen sizes.
4. It uses seven models to organise and interact with data.

#### The idea 

Friends of mine often mentioned there is no widely accepted social platform for skakeboarders, or in fact any similar modern sports. When arriving in a new city, there was no way to know where the good skate spots are or who are the good skaters in the area.

After some research, it became clear that simply geotagging skate spots would not appeal to skaters, who often want to keep their best spots secret. The idea was adapted to allow skaters to show off their skills and earn "fame" from other users, increasing their notoriety and making their trick videos go viral.

OLLIE (the name is derived from a common skate trick) is simply styled to allow for easy mobile use, with no complicated menus cluttering the user interface. The plan was for the videos to take centre stage.
